This project aims to develop an efficient spam detection system using machine learning techniques, including Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify emails as either spam or ham (legitimate email).
This project predicts the spam mails and avoid us from cyber attacks.
The accuracy of Naive Bayes is 0.96650
The accuracy of Decision Tree is 0.957535
The accuracy of Support Vector Machine is 0.986244
The Ham mails are 4825.
The Spam mails are 675.
